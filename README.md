# PolarisIQ

**AI-Driven Data Engine**

PolarisIQ is a **local, GPU-accelerated analytical intelligence engine** that converts natural language queries into structured data analysis, machine learning workflows, and visualizations — all running on your local system.

Built on DuckDB, Polars, Scikit-learn, and Qwen2.5 (GGUF via llama-cpp), PolarisIQ delivers deterministic, cost-aware, and tool-controlled analytics without relying on cloud services.

## Key Features

* Natural language → structured analytical execution
* Aggregation, correlation, regression, classification
* Built-in graph generation (line, scatter, bar)
* Cost-aware execution routing
* Autonomous multi-step workflows
* Tool-calling agent architecture
* Plan caching + adaptive engine optimization
* Fully local execution (no external API calls)
